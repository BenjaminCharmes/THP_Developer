<h1 align="center">Day 67 of The Hacking Project: Introduction to Algorithms !</h1>

The notion of an algorithm goes back to antiquity. It became more precise in the field of mathematics through the use of variables. The algorithm in the computer sense appeared with the invention of the first machines with automatic functions. As algorithms developed, scientists wanted to formally and rigorously state what the efficiency of an algorithm was and they realised that it was necessary to compare algorithms with each other. In this lesson, we will review these methods by comparing several sorting algorithms with each other.
