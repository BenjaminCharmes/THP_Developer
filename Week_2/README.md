<h1 align="center">Week 14 of The Hacking Project: Introduction to Algorithms !</h1>

This week you will meet a world that is probably unknown to you because it is not directly related to the world of the web, but which is essential to know in the career of a developer in the broad sense. During the first 3 days, you can say goodbye to your web browser because you will never have to open it, everything will happen within your terminal! Then you can open it again for the last 2 days to set up the algorithm in a tic-tac-toe game, so that you will never be bored on your computer again and can fight against your AI!
