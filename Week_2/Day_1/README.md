Today you are going to learn how to use a rather advanced notion of algorithmics: recursion. It is a very abstract notion that requires a rather different logic and not necessarily intuitive for everyone. But in some logic problems, it is essential to implement if you don't want to end up with an algorithm that you can't even understand the day after you wrote it.
